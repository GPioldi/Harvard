# Harvard CS50 – Solutions, Exercises & Projects

Welcome to my public archive for **CS50 – Introduction to Computer Science** by Harvard University. Here you will find my solved problem sets, the final project, and personal study notes.

> **Academic Honesty Reminder**  
> This repository exists for learning and reference. If you are currently enrolled in CS50, *do not copy* any code: read it, understand it, and then write your own.

Extra folders:

- **.github/** – issue templates and CI/CD workflows.  
- **scripts/** – helper tools for linting, formatting, and testing.

> Exercise files keep the original CS50 filenames (e.g. `credit.c`, `recover.c`, `finance/`).

## Prerequisites & Setup

1. **Git** – clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CS50.git
   cd CS50
   ```
2. **C compiler** (GCC or Clang) – required for the early problem sets.
3. **Python 3.10+** – for weeks 5–6.
4. **SQLite 3** – for SQL exercises.
5. **Pipenv** or **virtualenv** (optional) – to manage Python environments.

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use This Material

- Each folder includes a `README_local.md` with set-specific notes.  
- Testing scripts (`check50` and `pytest`) are bundled when relevant.  
- Browse the commit history to watch my solutions evolve over time.

### Example: Run a C exercise
```bash
cd week4/filter
make filter
./filter images/lenna.bmp out.bmp
```
